This repository contains all my solutions for the assignments along with the code (both Python and Latex), and my final project, *Arietta*, a Python module which allows to implement all cases of both elementary and life-like cellular automata. The PDF file for the presentation can also be found in the respective folder.   

I'm quite happy with the course and the work done. It was wonderful!
